# TeDDi_cleaning
Cleaning of the [TeDDi](https://github.com/MorphDiv/TeDDi_sample) corpus: scripts and review of issues


# How to use
Most of scripts require a Python library [Polyglot](https://polyglot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/):

Install it first:
```
pip install polyglot
```

The PDF file reports the issues that were identified.
At the end of the file, I describe the status of the issues as of 30.09.2022.
